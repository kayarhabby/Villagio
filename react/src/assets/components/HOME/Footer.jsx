                <small>
                    The demo content in German is not a professional translation! It’s sample data used to
                    demonstrate a multilingual website (localization was performed via WPML plugin, which is NOT
                    included into the theme).

                    Note: multi-currency is performed via addon, which is NOT included into the theme.
